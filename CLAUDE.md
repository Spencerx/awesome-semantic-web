# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "Awesome Semantic Web" repository - a curated list of semantic web and linked data resources. It's a documentation-only repository containing primarily the README.md file with categorized links to semantic web tools, standards, libraries, and resources.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - The main curated list containing all semantic web resources organized by category
- `LICENSE` - Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license
- No build system, dependencies, or code compilation required

## Contributing Guidelines

### Adding New Resources

To add new items to the list:
1. Submit a pull request with additions to README.md
2. Add items to the appropriate category section
3. Follow the existing formatting: `- [Name](URL) - Description`
4. Alternatively, add suggestions to [issues/awesomelets](https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web/issues/81)

### Pull Request Process

- Pull requests are evaluated immediately for inclusion
- Ensure new additions are relevant to semantic web/linked data
- Place items in the most appropriate category
- Follow alphabetical ordering within categories where applicable

### Content Categories

The README is organized into major sections including:
- Standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SHACL, SPARQL, etc.)
- Programming language libraries
- Tools and platforms
- Databases and triple stores
- Visualization tools
- Datasets and ontologies
- Research resources

## Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation repository with no build process:
- No compilation, testing, or linting commands needed
- Main task is editing README.md to add/update resource listings
- Verify links are valid and descriptions are accurate
- Maintain consistent formatting across all entries
